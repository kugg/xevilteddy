This is a proof of concept application that grabs all keystrokes typed into
the current X11 session and injects a harmless command whenever a Gnome
Terminal window is given focus. This is possible even when confined by
technologies such as the Ubuntu Snap packaging format. It is based on xteddy,
whose original README follows.

Original README

This directory contains the source to my creation 'xteddy',
version 1.1 of April 22, 1998.
The single file xteddy.tar.gz contains all you need. If you
have problems with binary FTP or GNU zip, there is an
uncompressed xteddy.tar, too.
