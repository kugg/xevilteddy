<h2>About Xteddy</h2>
<h3>(From the desk of
<a href="http://www.itn.liu.se/~stegu/">the author</a>)</h3>
<p>I created Xteddy in 1994 as a spare time hack for fun. The
reception he got from my colleagues was so heart-warming I
was encouraged to distribute him world-wide. Much to my
surprise, the response was overwhelming. By now, I have
received hundreds of friendly messages of appreciation from
all over the world, and they keep dropping in even three years
after the release. To all of you teddy bear lovers out there:
<strong>thanks!</strong>
</p>
<p>The teddy bear image is a photo of a Tender Teddy from
<a href="http://www.gund.com">Gund</a>.
I have the original sitting on my non-virtual desktop at work.
</p>
<h3>Compilation</h3>
<p>Xteddy should compile on most Unix/X systems. He has been
reported to run properly without modifications on SunOS,
Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, A/UX, Irix and Linux, among others, and
he is compatible with X11R4, R5 and R6 as well as all versions
of OpenWindows.
Should you encounter any problems, let me know and I'll try to help.
</p>

<h3>Your own teddy bear</h3>
<p>If you would rather like to have the program display an image of
your own teddy bear, or one you wish you had, it isn't that difficult.
Instructions may
be found in the documentation supplied with the source code in the
distribution of Xteddy. Additional information is available from
me by request. I might even volunteer to take an image of your
favorite teddy and convert it to the appropriate format, but I
make no promises. It takes some manual editing. A high quality
digital color image, about 300 pixels wide or so, taken against
a plain background in a contrasting colour, preferably white,
is what I need to consider doing it.

<h3>Port to Windows 95 and Windows NT available!</h3>
<p>Recently, I had a very pleasant surprise. Claudio Felber of
Cybernetic (felber@cybernetic.ch) finally managed to port Xteddy
to Windows32 (NT and 95). The port was painful, but it is skilfully
and cleverly done, it works, and it looks very good on any reasonably
fast PC. The official release will be available from Claudio soon,
but I have a copy here as well for you to grab and unzip.

<h3>Port to OS/2 available</h3>
<p>A port of Xteddy that runs under the Presentation Manager of OS/2
(which is a sadly underestimated operating system) has been performed
by Alessandro Mascherpa
(<a href="mailto:mascherpa@txt.it">mascherpa@txt.it</a>).
There are no true shaped windows under OS/2, so this port uses a somewhat
ugly but rather clever workaround. The archive can be downloaded from the URL:<br>
