/* 1997-08-07: (1.0.3)                              */
/* Added -display and -noquit options. Changed the  */
/* names of options "-f" and "-w" to "-float" and   */
/* "-wm" for clarity reasons.                       */

/* 1994-02-11: (1.0.2) Touched up the icon bitmap.  */
/* Made xteddy aware of reparenting in order to     */
/* get the coordinates right for mouse movements.   */
/* Joined the color and grayscale pixmaps into one  */
/* single file. The choice between grayscale or     */
/* color is now made by the Xpm library function.   */

/* 1994-02-01: (1.0.1) Compacted the large pixmap   */
/* files to 1 char per pixel to save about 100K     */
/* in both the source and the executable.           */
/* Fixed some minor bugs to compile on other        */
/* platforms than Sun.                              */
/* Added a command-line option -w to make xteddy    */
/* use the window manager if desired.               */
/* Added a manpage. (Thanks to Reinhard Zierke)     */
/* Added an option -f to make xteddy float on top   */
/* of all windows. (suggested by Bert Gijsbers)     */

/* 1994-01-20: First working version (1.0).         */
/* Supports mono, grayscale and color displays.     */
